# Sem 5 Java Programs

Collection of Java lab programs for 5th semester.

### Note:

- Some of the programs don't properly run as expected and some are incomplete.
- You may need to edit the package names in each of the files to run it in eclipse IDE.
- Some programs have my local path to some folders, so you may need to change them in order to run them. 
- DB program is using the MariaDB driver at the moment, so you may need to download that too. If you're using Arch linux, find it [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mariadb-jdbc/).
- You also need to update and add tables in SQL before using jdbc.
